# Markdown Previewer

Hey there! This is my Markdown Previewer project, built with **React** and **Vite**. It's a simple app that lets you write markdown in one section and see the live preview in another. You can even download the preview as an image! Pretty cool, right?

## Features
- **Editor**: Write your markdown in the editor section.
- **Preview**: Instantly see the rendered markdown in the preview section.
- **Download**: Save the preview as an image (PNG format).
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes.

- **Editor.jsx**: The editor where you type your markdown.
- **Preview.jsx**: Displays the live preview of your markdown.
